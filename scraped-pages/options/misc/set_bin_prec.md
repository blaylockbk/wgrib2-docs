### wgrib2: -set\_bin\_prec



### Introduction



The values at the grid points points are stared in a general format,


```


  Y = (R + i*2**B)*(10**D)

  R = reference value (32-bit IEEE floating point number)
  i = integer, 0..2**N-1
  N = binary bit precision
  B = binary scaling, -127..127
  D = decimal scaling, -127..127

```


There are 3 sytems for storing the number which I have called


```


ECMWF convention: D = 0, N = parameter

  Y = R + i*2**B
  R = reference value
  i = integer, 0..2**N-1
  N = binary bit precision, a parameter
  B = binary scaling, determined by grib routines

NCEP convention: B = parameter, D = parameter

  R = reference value
  i = integer, 0..2**N-1
  N = binary bit precision, determined by grib routines
  B = binary scaling, a parameter
  D = decimal scaling, a parameter

  Note, global model uses a variant: B = 0, D = parameter

```


Both the ECMWF and NCEP conventions have their advantages and
disadvantages. The ECMWF method is easier to use, you just
set the binary precision to N bits (12? 16?) for all variables
and you are done. With the NCEP convention, you have to 
set the scaling for each variable separately. For some variables
such as specific humidity, the scaling should be pressure
dependent. On the other hand, if you are trying to get the smallest
files, the NCEP convention is better. For example, you want to
get the RH to the nearest integer. With the NCEP method, you simply
set D = B = 0. For general use, I suggest that you use the ECMWF
convention because people time is usually more valuable than disk space.
Ok, I value my time more than a few GB. On the othe hand, I've been
involved with more than my share of projects were disk space
has been the critical issue.

By the way, the wgrib2 default for encoding grib is 12-bits using
the ECMWF convention. 

### Usage


The -set\_bin\_prec option is used to
set wgrib2 to encode data using the ECMWF convention.



```

-set_bin_prec N
  N = number of bits to encode grid point data
  N should be â‰¤ 25 for the current version of wgrib2

  if N is > 12, you need to increase the maximum bits of allowed
  precision by -set_grib_max_bits

```
