# Documentation for wgrib2 (unofficial)

The [wgrib2 documentation](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/) is hard to follow. I would like to scrape those pages and rebuilt the documentation using Sphinx and hosting on readthedocs. These, of course, would be **unofficial** documents.

- [ ] Get original docs (what are all the links)
- [ ] Convert to Markdown
- [ ] Edit the docs as needed
- [ ] Build new docs with Sphinx (use pyData theme)
