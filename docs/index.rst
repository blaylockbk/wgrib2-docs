Documentation for wgrib2 (unofficial)
=====================================

**üèóÔ∏è Work In Progress**

This is a remake of the `wgrib2 documentation <https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/>`_. I scrapped the documentation HTML pages, converted them to Markdown, rebuilt the pages with Sphinx, and hosted them on readthedocs. These, of course, are **unofficial** documentation for wgrib2. I primarily did this because it's sometimes hard to find the right page I'm looking for in the official docs and remade the docs for mainly my own benefit.

Goals
-----
- Searchable documentation
- More logical organization, easier to find
- Provide more examples
- Make open source and invite others to contribute.
- Correct any wrong information
- Improve the visual presentation with additional formatting
