=======================================
The unofficial documentation for wgrib2
=======================================

**üèóÔ∏è Work In Progress**

This is a remake of the original `wgrib2 documentation <https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/>`_. I scrapped the documentation HTML pages, converted them to Markdown, rebuilt the pages with Sphinx, and hosted them on readthedocs. These, of course, are **unofficial** documentation for wgrib2. I primarily did this because it's sometimes hard to find the right page I'm looking for in the official docs and remade the docs for mainly my own benefit.

Wgrib2 has the following abilities.

- inventory and read grib2 files
- create subsets
- create regional subsets by cookie cutter or projections
- export to ieee, text, binary, CSV, netcdf and mysql
- import to ieee, text, binary, and netcdf
- write of new grib2 fields
- parallel processing by using threads (OpenMP)
- parallel processing by flow-based programming
